# image-to-code: Copy Discipline and Anti-Drift (Sections 26-27)

## 26. DESIGN-TO-CODE COPY DISCIPLINE

After generating and analyzing the reference image(s), implement the website in a copy-oriented way.

This means:

- follow the references closely
- preserve layout logic
- preserve spacing rhythm
- preserve section ordering
- preserve text/image balance
- preserve typography mood
- preserve component style
- preserve overall visual cleanliness

Do not drift into a different design direction during implementation.
Do not “improve” the design by replacing it with a generic coded layout.

The goal is not:

- inspired by the image

The goal is:

- visually faithful to the image, translated into real frontend

## 27. ANTI-DRIFT IMPLEMENTATION RULE

A common failure mode is design drift:
the generated images look strong, but the coded result becomes generic.

Strictly avoid that.

During implementation:

- do not simplify into default templates
- do not replace distinctive sections with generic rows
- do not compress generous spacing into dense layout
- do not replace strong typography with plain hierarchy
- do not remove the page’s visual identity for convenience
- do not merge section logic into repetitive patterns that were not present in the source images
- do not reintroduce nested-box complexity that was intentionally removed during analysis

The final coded result should still feel like the same website as the generated references.
